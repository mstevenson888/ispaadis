# Function to estimate the number of cattle herds in a village, given an estimate of the total number of cattle present

# nssu: integer, representing the total number of individuals in the population.
# psumin: integer, minimum herd size.
# psumode: integer, mode herd size.
# psumax: integer, max herd herd size.

# Returns a vector of estimated herd sizes.
